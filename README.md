# Customizable-Multiplication-Alerts
This JavaScript code defines two variables, 'a' and 'b', with values 3 and 2 respectively. It also contains a function called 'multiple' that takes an optional parameter 'x' with a default value of 8, and returns the result of multiplying 'x' by 3...
Another function named 'affichage' is defined, which triggers alerts displaying the result of calling 'multiple' with 'a', 'b', and without any argument, demonstrating the versatility of the 'multiple' function.
